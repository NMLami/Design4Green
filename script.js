     "description": "It is common to hear that digital is 'green', meaning that it has little or no ecological impact, or even that it reduces the ecological impact of the rest of our economy. In this course, we will challenge both of these ideas. In fact, digital technology has real and growing ecological impacts: greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, toxic waste production, etc. Moreover, its capacity to reduce the ecological impacts of the rest of our economy is questionable (rebound effect, programmed obsolescence, etc.).\n\nThanks to concrete examples and practical cases, this course will give you an overview of the stakes and the means available to make the digital sector more ecological. Following this course will give you the tools to be an actor of a more ecological digital world. You will be able to reduce the ecological impact of an IS, that of a website and to get involved in the eco-design of a digital service.\n\nDo you want to deploy Green IT actions in your company?

In a report by ADEME (Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maîtrise de l'Énergie) published in 2019, this sector is described as \"responsible for 4% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions and the sharp increase in usage suggests that this carbon footprint will double by 2025\" (\"La face cachée du numérique\", ADEME). In addition to its impact in terms of energy consumption, the ever-increasing role of digital technology in our societies also has numerous social and societal impacts and raises ethical questions that an engineer, a player in the digital transition, cannot ignore.\n\nThe objective of this course is to provide students with :\n- the keys to understanding the environmental, social and societal challenges of the digital transformation of companies and society\n- a toolbox that will enable them to contribute to a responsible digital transformation\n\nOrganisation of the EU :\n- A synthetic and exhaustive inventory of the impacts of digital technology: based on a workshop to understand the environmental, social and societal challenges of digital technology in a team and in a playful way (Digital Fresco).\n- Focus on a series of themes: digital and the environment, digital ethics, digital and geopolitics, responsible digital, digital and work\nStudents will learn about the circular economy, eco-design, life cycle analysis, rare metals, responsible digital, digital labor, etc. They will attend lectures and conferences and debate in order to explore each of these themes and to understand the elements of solutions.
